# MILLIONAIRE-GAME

Hello, welcome to this lesson. We tested **MILLIONAIRE-GAME** using HTML-5.  You can follow the steps below to analyze the codes we wrote and the result obtained.
You can watch the **Millionaire** game I compiled using only **HTML** without any **CSS** and **JS**.
 <br/> I have used many **HTML** tags here. First, using the **img**, **audio**, **map**, and **area** tags on the front page, I gave the coordinates using the 
 **area** tag instead of "Start the game" in the picture. I also uploaded game music to the beginning of the game (here I gave an invisible sound effect by giving the **audio** tag the **autoplay** attribute). 
 <br/> Then I typed the game registration form using the **form** and **input** tags. And for the next part of the game, I used 6 questions here and created separate **html** files for each question. At the top of each question, I created a slide of the pictures related to the question using the **marquee** tag, and I also placed **Clock ("TikTok")** sound in all of these questions using the **audio** tag.
 <br/> After finding the correct answer to question 1, **a target = _parent href = "./ tap.html** will automatically show you the correct question. The correct answer is **green** and the incorrect answers are **grey**. appears and also stops **clock sound**. 
 <br/> When you answer the 2nd question correctly, this time in the correct answer items comes a short **commercial** that I made earlier with the help of **video** tag. Then go to question 3, giving "Pass the ad". 
 <br/>Here we use 2 icons that I placed inside the **table** tag (these are **50:50**, **Audience Help** icons.). In question 3, we use the **50:50** icon, and out of 4 answers, 2 automatically go to the wrong one. And here are 2 answers that are likely to be correct, then we choose the correct answer, and when we move on to question 3, we no longer see the **50:50** icon on our **table**. 
 <br/> Then we move on to the 4th question, and as we pass each question, our **Points** increase. In Question 5, we can now use the **Audience Help** icon and the **meter** tag in front of the answers, where we can get help as a percentage in front of the answers. After that, we have reached the final stage by writing the correct answer. 
 <br/>Here, if my answer to the question is wrong, we can no longer skip to question 2, and below is the **Home** link, and so we return to the front of the game.
